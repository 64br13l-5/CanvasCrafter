WorkLog:

Alisa: add buttons for pen and eraser and work on ctrl z
5/25/22
Alisa: continue working on undo and redo so that pressing ctrl and z at the same time will call the undo

Alisa: finalize/fix undo and redo and continue working on the eraser

Alisa: attempted to add a hashmap of paints to use for the eraser but did not push this because it proved to be fruitless. also tried to use Color to make transparency
